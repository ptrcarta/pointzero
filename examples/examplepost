TITLE post di prova'  

#everything below this line is content (html)

<p>
I want to start blogging about technical matters, and the platform I chose is important.<br>
while there's a lot of platforms available, I feel like it would be harder to integrate the
existing one into my existing website design instead of buildin a new one.<br>
What I wanted was:
<ul>
<li>a page for blogposts, one after another</li>
<li>individual pages for each post</li>
<li>for it to be static</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted it static cause while posting happens seldom, reading is (hopely) more frequent, so it's more sensible
in a low performance situation to serve static pages compiled once, rather than generate them each time.
It also cuts db overhead and provides basically no vulnerability points.</p>
<p>
For now I will be content to be writing html so everything I need is to simpy parse a text file. For this my
language of choice is bash because right now it's what I'm more confortable with. I hope it will be useful for others too,
even in its ghetto style. Enjoy!
