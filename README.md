##PointZero static blog builder
Bash blog builder. You feed it a date and the raw html for the content of each blog article and it builds individual and indexed pages.

###Dependencies
I try to keep this low dependencies.
Apart from bash, it makes use of gnu-sed or ssed specific functions. on OSX/*BSD default sed won't cut it.
